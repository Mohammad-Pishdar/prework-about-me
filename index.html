      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a foremr agronomist turned web developer. I've just started my journey
         and taking my first baby steps in the hopes I can ultimatley have a career
         as a web deveoper.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Iran but immigrated to Australia about 5 years ago and are 
        about to get my Australian citizenship soon.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my sare time, I like to watch soccer and play video games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I always wanted to have a job in IT even when I was working as a research
        agronomist for more than 9 years. After thinking about it a lot and doing
        my research, I believe I can safely say that being the best web developer
        I can be is my idea of a dream job.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Sydney. I've been here since my arrival to Australia back in 
        late 2014, and I consider it a hometown.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Well, I have had a lot of thinking and took some courses and left most of 
        them unfinished. I was fascinated with the idea of becoming a programmer
        but the more I have learned about programming, the more I have realised 
        that I wanted to mix that with ceative design and that's what web development
        let me to do. Besides, web developers are in high demand in the job market
        and this is the kind of skill that can give you a better chance of finding 
        a tech job in such comeptetive field and that's why I decided to do whatever
        it takes to gain these skills and become a web developer.
